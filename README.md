# SparkBooks-Online-book-store
This website is an online bookstore developed using Flask

How to run this Flask app on a localhost server:
1. Download all the files and navigate to run.py in cmd of your computer.
2. Once there, run python run.py if you are on windows or python3 run.py if you are on linux.
3. The localhost server should be running and you can view the app on the browser by typing 127.0.0.1:5000 or just simply localhost:5000 in the address bar of your favorite browser.

I could not upload all the pictures for the books as the folder got too large for github but I was able to upload a default cover page for every book.
Cover pages for all books can be seen in the actual sparkbooks website once i have hosted it.
